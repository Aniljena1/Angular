=======================================================================================================================


1.What is Angular and its features?
Ans: Angular is typescript based open-source froent end platform, devloped by google. It helps the devloper 
         to creat SPA on the client side.
     It is based on MVC pattern and allow you to build well structure, easiley testable and maintaible front-end applications.
       Features of Angular:The features of this framework
      1.CrossPlatform
      2.Speed & Performance
      3.Declarative templates
      4.dependency injection
      4.end to end tooling

2.Describe about MVC architecture.
 M - model represents the data we are working with as well as business
   - The Data format used by model in angulr is JSON.

 V - It represent a tempalte that renders HTML
   - It defines Application UI

 C - It Handels the overall application flow.
   - It handels the communication between model and view.
   - Angular controller is '.ts ' file

3.  What are new features in Angular 9?

->new compiler IVY is the new default compiler(previous view engien)
-support typeScript version 3.7
-Allow better debuging application
-AOT is enabled for devlopment mode also.(AOT is stand for ahead -of-timecompiler). 
  It is used for pre-compiling the application components and along with there templated during binding process.

4.  How to upgrade Angular8 to 9 ?
- npm uninstall -g angular-cli 
- npm cache verify
- npm cache clean
-npm install -g @angular/cli@latest

5.  What is Express.js ?
-Express is a module framework for Node that we can use for apllication.
-Express module used to  devlop the REST API.

6.  What is Mongoose and its version ?

- Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling(ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data,
  provides schema validation.
-latest version of Mongoose is 5.9.12 

7.  What is the purpose of Express.js with Node.js ?

Express.js is a Node js web application server framework, which is specifically designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

The MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications which has the following components;

1) MongoDB - The standard NoSQL database

2) Express.js - The default web applications framework

3) Angular.js - The JavaScript MVC framework used for web applications

4) Node.js - It is an opensoure,cross platform and javascript based servr side technology built in google 
             chrome v8 compiler
           - It is asynchronous and single-threead with non-blocking technique 

7.  What Is The Purpose Of Using Package.json In The Angular Project ?
   -> Package.json - It contents the metadata of package installed in your application. which includes,version,calture,repository details etc..

8.  What Is The Purpose Of Using angular.json In The Angular Project ?
   -> angular.json - It contents the metadata of application, which includes,version,calture,repository details etc..

9.  What Is The Purpose Of ngIf, ngfor & ngSubmit Directive ?
   -> ngFor - It is an iterator used performing iteration over a collection,(used binding complex data to view)
   -> nfIf - It is used to Add or remove components from dom based given condition.
   ->ngSubmit - a form group can submit its value dynamically by using the event "ngSubmit".

10.  What Is String Interpolation In Angular ?
   ->The values are binded to any attribute by using interpolation.it requires a binding expression{{}}

10.  Observables VS Promises ?
    Promises -> It handle single event
    Observables -> it is a stream that allows passing of more than one event.

11.  What Is The Use Of Rxjs In Angular8  ?
   ->Rxjs is a library used client application for handling asynchronous request to any API.
   ->It provides functionality which includes handling
     1. STREAM 2.OBSERVER 3.OBSERVABLE 4.SUBSCRIBER 5.OBJECT

12.  How We Can Achieve Routing ?
 ->Routing is a technique used in a web application to creat and configure user and SEO friendly URL,We can sites
    with links that direct you to a new page.
  it can be achieved using routing.Here the pages that we are refering to will be in the form of components.

13.  How To Pass Data From One Component To Other ?
     
      parent componet to child component -> @input
      child componet to parent component - >@output

14.  What Are The Angular Life Cycle Hooks.
       -constructor
       -ngOnchanges
       -ngOninit
       -ngDoCheck
            -ngAfterContentInit
            -ngAfterContentChecked
            -ngAfterViewInit
            -ngAfterViewChecked
            -ngOnDestroy
   
15.  What Is Dependency Injection(DI) ?
-> Dependency -> Is an object or service that can used in another object.
              ->The Dependency tha we are injecting in a contructor is an opbject of the class that we want to use.
-> Injection ->An injection is the process of passing the dependency to an dependent object.It creat a new instance of a class that we want to use.


16.  Lazy Loading?
 ->Lazy loading is one of the most useful concepts of Angular Routing. It help us to download the webpages in chunks instead of downloading everything in a big bundle.

17.  import vs require
  -> require - will automatically scan(node module) to find modules.
  -> import - act same as require

18.  Why Schema ?
 ->It makes search results richer and super for the average searcher.

19.  formGroup , formControls & FormBuilder
  -> FormControl - A FormControl class is used to configure any form elememnt dynamically.It contents a set up property 
                   that are used that are used to configure and manipulet a control.
 -> FormGroup - A Form Group is collection of form controls which you can dynamically add into a component.

 FormBuilder
------------
->A FormBuilder is responsible for configure the form elements dynamically.
->It responsible for configuring the memory at the time of initializing the components  into memory by using 
  a single tern pattern.


20.  What is API in Angular?

21.  What is the purpose of ngOnInit?
  -> ngOnInit method which are executed on component load, The ngOnInit method called after
     the constructor is executed.

22.  What are constructors in angular?
  -> constructors is not a part of angular, it is a part of TypeScript, It is used to creat a new instance in a class

21.  navigateByUrl   ?

22.  What Is Prompt Box In JavaScript ?
  ->The prompt() method displays a dialog box that prompts the visitor for input.

23.  Is it possible to  change port no in Angular Application ?
   ->ng serve --host 0.0. 0.0 --port 5000

24.  why we use Cors & body-Parser Module ?
     -> cors ->This module used to enable the communication between different ports.
     -> body-parser -> This module used to read the POST parameter  sent by client application.
     -> sacket.io -> This module used to devlop the chat application.

Observables and Subscribe
-------------------------
->When we send and recieve data over HTTP may take time, Observable is sbscribed by using asnyc pipe or by using sbuscribe method.
->observable observe the request and response
->It implicitly converts the data and emits so that any data object can consume the data.
->Some methods of Observable map,mergeMap,switchMap,exhaustMap,debounceTime,of,retry,catch,throw etc
Subscribe
----------
->subscribing is the process of tracking the request and response headers.
-> It includes details like status,data ,config

HttpClient
------------
->httpClient is performing HTTP request and response.
->HttpClient is am improved replacement for HTTP.
->You most import HttpClientModule after BrowserModule in your angular apps.
->import fro @angulr/common/http
->The HttpCLient class provided by HttpCLientModule contents the setup proerties and 
  method that are used to handle various request from an API.
or subscribe method is used by observable in order to handle the request headers .

28. What is npm?
 -> npm is a package manager for the javascript programming language, It is the default package manager for the
    javascript runtime environment Node.js
 -> The npm programming is installed on your computer when you installed Node.js
 ->npm can install packages in local or global mode

29. What is <router-outlet>
 ->is a dynamic component that the router uses to displays views based on router navigations.

30. promise vs Observables
-> both promise and Observables provied us with abstractions that help us deal with the asynchronous nature of 
   our application.
   promise problms -> If you want to cancel,retry a request to the API.
                   -> As your application get bigger , Promise become hard to manage.
   Observables -> is an array or sequence of events over time ,
               -> There are aslo powerful operators like retry(),or replay(), retryWhen(), delay()

31. Constructor vs ngOnInit
    Constructor  -> It creats an instances of the component class.
                 -> It called first before ngOnInit()
    ngOnInit -> ngOnInit function is one of an angular component life-cycle method.
             ->Life cycle method in angular components allow you to run a piece of code at the different stages 
               of the life of component.
              ->ngOnInit method is called shortly after the component is created.
